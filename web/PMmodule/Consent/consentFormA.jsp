		<p>“CAISI is a community project.</p>
		<p>The CAISI program was created to link many of the city's health and shelter 
		service agencies together so that people who are homeless can get better and 
		faster services from them.  The program wants people who are homeless to have 
		control over their personal information and to have a better quality of life.  
		Your personal information is now stored on computers at the different places you get care. 
		 With your permission, this information will be sent to other agencies when you seek services 
		 from them so that they can give you better care.  The types of agencies are: 
		</p>
		<li>Hospitals
		<li>Ambulance services
		<li>Public health
		<li>Outreach teams
		<li>Shelters
		<li>Mental health teams
		<li>Related agencies that are CAISI partners

		<p>In the CAISI program, only those people who give you care will be able to see your information.  
		CAISI is set up so that people with similar jobs and training can communicate with one another. 
		 For example, only health care teams will be allowed to see detailed medical information.</p>
		 
		<p>Your information will be used by this agency and by other agencies to give you better care.  
		Your information will be put together with the information from other people who are homeless 
		to improve the services offered, to do research, and to compile statistics for advocacy.   </p>
		
		<p>Your care at <c:out value="${agency.name}"/> will not change by allowing agencies to
		send information and work together through CAISI.</p>
		
		<p>You may withdraw permission to send information to other agencies
		at any time. To withdraw, contact <c:out value="${agency.name}"/> staff or any other CAISI
		partner.Your care at <c:out value="${agency.name}"/> will not change if you withdraw permission.  </p>
		
		<p>Any questions can be directed to <c:out value="${agency.name}"/> staff.”</p>
		
		<p>You are allowed to ask for more information about CAISI and/or to talk to your worker or other people 
		about CAISI.  You are allowed to make decisions based on this information.  </p>
