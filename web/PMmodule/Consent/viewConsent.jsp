		care for you so they can provide you better care. These other agencies

		<li>Ambulance services.
		<li>Public health.
		<li>Outreach teams.
		<li>Shelters.
		<li>Mental health teams.

		<p>In these agencies, your information will only be seen by those with
		the appropriate training. For example, only health care teams will be
		allowed to see detailed medical information.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this program is to send information to agencies when

		compile statistics.</p>
